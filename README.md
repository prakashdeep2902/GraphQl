GraphQL is a **query language** for APIs and a **runtime** for executing those queries. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015. Unlike REST APIs, where the server defines the structure of responses, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features of GraphQL:

1. **Flexible Queries**: Clients can request exactly what they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
2. **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST (which often has multiple endpoints), GraphQL operates via a **single endpoint** (e.g., `/graphql`).
3. **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL uses a schema that defines types and relationships between data.
4. **Real-Time Data with Subscriptions**: Supports real-time updates using **subscriptions**.
5. **Batching and Caching**: Reduces multiple API calls by fetching all related data in a single request.

### ðŸ”¹ GraphQL vs REST:

| Feature       | REST API                                      | GraphQL API                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoints     | Multiple endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`) | Single endpoint (`/graphql`)                 |
| Data Fetching | Fixed responses, may over-fetch               | Flexible queries, fetch only required fields |
| Versioning    | Uses versioning (v1, v2, etc.)                | No versioning needed (schema evolves)        |
| Performance   | May require multiple requests                 | Single request can fetch all needed data     |
| Real-time     | Uses WebSockets or polling                    | Supports **subscriptions**                   |

### ðŸ”¹ Example of GraphQL Query:

A client requests **only the data it needs**:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Example GraphQL Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "GraphQL Basics",
          "content": "GraphQL is a powerful API query language..."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This avoids unnecessary data and optimizes performance.
